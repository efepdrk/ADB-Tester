## Description

My first WPF app.
Originally developed for test automation via ADB on android TV devices.

All features listed should currently be working as expected; however, it still is a very much work in progress program in it's current state.



## Features 

- ADB over USB or Network
- Recording inputs
- Saving and loading inputs to and from a file
- Playback of recorded inputs
- Ability to play the recording multiple times


## Planned: 
- Appium integration
- More user friendly UI
